<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz" target="_blank">Fizz Buzz</a> is a classic substitution game, where players count incrementally, replacing numbers divisible by 3 with 'Fizz' and numbers divisible by 5 with 'Buzz'.</p>
<p>Example: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16...</p>
<p>The game is often used to test people's knowledge of a given programming language because it incorporates many key concepts, like loops, division and logic statements.  In college, one of my professors gave me a modified version of Fizz Buzz.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p>Write a program that lists numbers from 100 to 0. Replace numbers divisible by 3 with 'Fizz' and number divisible by 5 with 'Buzz'.  Numbers that are both divisible by 3 and 5 should be replaced with 'FizzBuzz'.  When the program reaches 0 print 'Blast off!!!'.</p>
